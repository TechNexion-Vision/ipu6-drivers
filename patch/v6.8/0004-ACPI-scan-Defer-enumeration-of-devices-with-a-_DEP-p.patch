Subject: [PATCH 04/12] ACPI: scan: Defer enumeration of devices with a _DEP
 pointing to IVSC device

Inside IVSC, switching ownership requires an interface with two
different hardware modules, ACE and CSI. The software interface
to these modules is based on Intel MEI framework. Usually mei
client devices are dynamically created, so the info of consumers
depending on mei client devices is not present in the firmware
tables.

This causes problems with the probe ordering with respect to
drivers for consumers of these MEI client devices. But on these
camera sensor devices, the ACPI nodes describing the sensors all
have a _DEP dependency on the matching MEI bus ACPI device, so
adding IVSC MEI bus ACPI device to acpi_honor_dep_ids allows
solving the probe-ordering problem by deferring the enumeration of
ACPI-devices which have a _DEP dependency on an IVSC mei bus ACPI
device.

Add INTC10CF, the HID of IVSC MEI bus ACPI device on MTL platform,
to acpi_honor_dep_ids.

config INTEL_TSENS_LOCAL_HOST
	bool "Temperature sensor driver for intel tsens"
	select THERMAL
	help
	  This option enables tsens thermal local Host driver.

	  This driver is used for reporting thermal data via thermal
	  framework.
	  Enable this option if you want to have support for thermal
	  management controller.
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as
	  Keem Bay.  If unsure, say N.

	select I2C_SLAVE
	help
	  This option enables tsens i2c slave driver.

	  This driver is used for reporting thermal data via I2C
	  SMBUS to remote host.
	  Enable this option if you want to have support for thermal
	  management controller
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as

	  Enable this option if you want to have support for Keem Bay
	  thermal management sensors.

	  This driver is used for reading onchip temperature sensor
	  values from Keem Bay SoC.

	depends on I2C_SMBUS
	help
	  This option enables tsens i2c and thermal local Host driver.

	  This driver is used for reading thermal data via I2C SMBUS
	  and registers itself to thermal framework, which can be
	  used by thermal daemon in remote IA host
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as

	  Enable this option if you want to have support for vpu cooling
	  driver for Movidius VPU

	  Movidius VPU coooling driver is registered as one of the
	  cooling agent to thermal framework. This driver communicates
	  with vpu to get/set power modes based on the thermal driver
	  requested states.
	  Say Y if using a processor that includes the Intel VPU such as
	  Keem Bay.  If unsure, say N.
